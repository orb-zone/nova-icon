# Specification Quality Checklist: Package Setup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (MVP vs post-MVP)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (via Clarifications section)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Refinement Changes (2025-10-24)

### Addressed Issues

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
- C2: Added explicit reference to type definition generation in Requirements section
- C3: Clarified MVP scope - README quickstart in MVP (Phase 1), full API docs post-MVP (Phase 7)

**Ambiguities Resolved**:
- A1: Added measurable performance criteria (60 FPS, <1% dropped frames, <50KB per icon, hardware acceleration)
- A2: Enumerated customizable properties (stroke weight, opacity, duration, delay, stagger)
- A3: Clarified MVP scope - Runtime API (Phase 3) in MVP, CLI tool (Phase 5) post-MVP, config validation (Phase 2) in MVP

**Duplications Resolved**:
- D1: Consolidated ESM-only requirement into Technical Requirements section (removed from general Requirements)
- D2: Removed redundant Bun testing mention from general Requirements (kept in Technical Requirements)

### Remaining Items for Plan/Tasks

The following items identified in analysis are **architectural concerns** that belong in plan.md and tasks.md, not spec.md:

- **I1 (project structure)**: Clarify contracts/ directory location - belongs in plan.md:176 and tasks.md
- **I2 (prerequisites)**: Clarify if contracts/component-schema.json exists before T010 - belongs in tasks.md:4
- **I3 (implementation approach)**: Spec now clarifies three approaches with MVP phasing - implementation details in plan/tasks
- **U1 (configuration values)**: Concrete config values belong in plan.md and tasks.md, not spec.md
- **U2 (verification tasks)**: Task-level verification belongs in tasks.md, not spec.md
- **U3 (rollback procedures)**: Operational procedure belongs in tasks.md, not spec.md

### Notes

- Specification now clearly distinguishes MVP from post-MVP scope
- All requirements are testable with measurable acceptance criteria
- Technical requirements maintain implementation-neutral language while providing concrete targets
- Customizable properties explicitly enumerated for clarity
- Performance optimization now includes quantifiable metrics from research.md findings
