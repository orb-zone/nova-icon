## Notes

- **High Priority**: CHK001-CHK010 (Completeness), CHK051-CHK053 (Security), CHK077-CHK080 (Constitution)
- **Medium Priority**: CHK011-CHK027 (Clarity/Consistency), CHK034-CHK047 (Scenarios/Edge Cases)
- **Low Priority**: CHK072-CHK076 (Traceability), CHK067-CHK071 (Ambiguities)
- Address CRITICAL items before starting implementation
- Review HIGH items during Phase 1 setup
- Consider MEDIUM items during component implementation
- LOW items can be addressed during documentation phase
