# Specification Quality Checklist: Light DOM Refactor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Pass: Content Quality
- ✅ No implementation details - spec focuses on what needs to change (light DOM vs shadow DOM) without dictating how
- ✅ User value focused - addresses Tailwind compatibility and performance
- ✅ Non-technical friendly - uses clear language about rendering behavior
- ✅ All mandatory sections present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Dependencies)

### Pass: Requirement Completeness
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements are clear from 001 implementation status
- ✅ Testable requirements - each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-003: "MUST NOT call attachShadow()")
- ✅ Measurable success criteria - SC-004: "0 skipped tests", SC-005: "1 symbol definition and 100 use references"
- ✅ Technology-agnostic criteria - focused on DOM structure and styling behavior, not implementation
- ✅ Acceptance scenarios defined - 3 scenarios per user story with Given/When/Then format
- ✅ Edge cases identified - 5 edge cases covering symbol registration, re-rendering, DOM manipulation
- ✅ Scope bounded - "Out of Scope" section explicitly excludes new features, API changes, build tooling
- ✅ Dependencies listed - NovaIconRegistry API, test suite, shared defs pattern

### Pass: Feature Readiness
- ✅ FRs have clear acceptance criteria - directly testable via test suite and DOM inspection
- ✅ User scenarios cover primary flows - P1: Tailwind compatibility, P2: Symbol sharing, P3: Test enablement
- ✅ Measurable outcomes - 6 success criteria covering styling, efficiency, and test coverage
- ✅ No implementation leaks - focuses on rendering patterns and behavior, not code structure

## Notes

✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization based on technical debt from 001-package-setup
- Concrete, verifiable success criteria
- Well-defined scope with explicit out-of-scope items
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- No ambiguity requiring clarification
